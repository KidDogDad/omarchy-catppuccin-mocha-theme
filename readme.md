# Catppuccin Mocha Theme For Omarchy

[Omarchy](http://omarchy.org/) includes a Catppuccin theme in its base config. But that theme, beautiful as it is, is Macchiato-flavored, and I suffer from a deep addiction to the Mocha flavor of Catppuccin in particular. This theme is for my fellow Omarchy users with a similar affliction. 

All but one of the wallpapers are sourced from the official Catppuccin repo. One of them is from another online repo that I can't track down now. If you are an artist and see your art on here, please contact me and I'd be happy to give you credit or take it down.
